# Secret Weapon 
## Program note

Secret Weapon is a piece developed in the SuperCollider environment, designed and composed by Juan Riera Gomez for his Live Coding class. It is the result of his experimentation and snippets of code from the SuperCollider documentation and from tutorials on the internet.

The set explores many aspects of SuperCollider, given the superficial knowledge of Juan on the environment. Some of these aspects include FM synthesis, drum sound generation and design, and distortion. Another field that is explored is how sounds interact with each other, sometimes dissapearing in a sidechain compression, and sometimes being distorted by the bass sounds.

It will be interpreted during the class on March 10th at Berklee College of Music, 150 building, room B54, at 9 am. The composer has made no tests on any equipment similar to the one in the classroom, and therefore, the outcome of the previosuly mentioned effects has some exciting unpredictability. On headphones sounds interesting, on a 2016 Macbook's speakers sounds distorted. We can only wait and see. Enjoy the piece!
